- 👋 Hi, I’m @kcobley
- 👀 I’m interested in far too many things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning. Especially with OO software - give me assembler any-day.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on - probably not much atm, but always interested in interesting things :-)
- 📫 How to reach me: wideopeniris@googlemail.com (the odd name is photography related and my name isn't Iris :-) )
